{"technique_id":"T1673","technique_name":"Virtual Machine Discovery","description":"An adversary may attempt to enumerate running virtual machines (VMs) after gaining access to a host or hypervisor. For example, adversaries may enumerate a list of VMs on an ESXi hypervisor using a Hypervisor CLI such as `esxcli` or `vim-cmd` (e.g. `esxcli vm process list or vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms`). Adversaries may also directly leverage a graphical user interface, such as VMware vCenter, in order to view virtual machines on a host. Adversaries may use the information from Virtual Machine Discovery during discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Subsequently discovered VMs may be leveraged for follow-on activities such as Service Stop or Data Encrypted for Impact.","detection":null,"procedures":["[S1096] Cheerscrypt: Cheerscrypt has leveraged `esxcli vm process list` in order to gather a list of running virtual machines to terminate them."],"tactics":"TA0007 - Discovery"}
