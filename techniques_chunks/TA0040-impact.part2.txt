{"technique_id":"T1561.002","technique_name":"Disk Wipe: Disk Structure Wipe","description":"Adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. Adversaries may attempt to render the system unable to boot by overwriting critical data located in structures such as the master boot record (MBR) or partition table. The data contained in disk structures may include the initial executable code for loading an operating system or the location of the file system partitions on disk. If this information is not present, the computer will not be able to load an operating system during the boot process, leaving the computer unavailable. Disk Structure Wipe may be performed in isolation, or along with Disk Content Wipe if all sectors of a disk are wiped. On a network devices, adversaries may reformat the file system using Network Device CLI commands such as `format`. To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for destroying disk structures may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other techniques like Valid Accounts, OS Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares.","detection":"Look for attempts to read/write to sensitive locations like the master boot record and the disk partition table.

By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.","detection":"Where applicable, inspect important file hashes, locations, and modifications for suspicious/unexpected values.","procedures":["[S0562] SUNSPOT: SUNSPOT created a copy of the SolarWinds Orion software source file with a .bk extension to backup the original content, wrote SUNBURST using the same filename but with a .tmp extension, and then moved SUNBURST using MoveFileEx to the original filename with a .cs extension so it could be compiled within Orion software.","[S1135] MultiLayer Wiper: MultiLayer Wiper changes the original path information of deleted files to make recovery efforts more difficult.","[G0082] APT38: APT38 has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions."],"tactics":"TA0040 - Impact"}

{"technique_id":"T1657","technique_name":"Financial Theft","description":"Adversaries may steal monetary resources from targets through extortion, social engineering, technical theft, or other methods aimed at their own financial gain at the expense of the availability of these resources for victims. Financial theft is the ultimate objective of several popular campaign types including extortion by ransomware, business email compromise (BEC) and fraud, \"pig butchering,\" bank hacking, and exploiting cryptocurrency networks. Adversaries may Compromise Accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds. In the case of business email compromise or email fraud, an adversary may utilize Impersonation of a trusted entity. Once the social engineering is successful, victims can be deceived into sending money to financial accounts controlled by an adversary. This creates the potential for multiple victims (i.e., compromised accounts as well as the ultimate monetary loss) in incidents involving financial theft. Extortion by ransomware may occur, for example, when an adversary demands payment from a victim after Data Encrypted for Impact and Exfiltration of data, followed by threatening to leak sensitive data to the public unless payment is made to the adversary. Adversaries may use dedicated leak sites to distribute victim data. Due to the potentially immense business impact of financial theft, an adversary may abuse the possibility of financial theft and seeking monetary gain to divert attention from their true goals such as Data Destruction and business disruption.","detection":null,"procedures":["[G1032] INC Ransom: INC Ransom has stolen and encrypted victim's data in order to extort payment for keeping it private or decrypting it.","[G1021] Cinnamon Tempest: Cinnamon Tempest has maintained leak sites for exfiltrated data in attempt to extort victims into paying a ransom.","[G1026] Malteiro: Malteiro targets organizations in a wide variety of sectors via the use of Mispadu banking trojan with the goal of financial theft.","[G0094] Kimsuky: Kimsuky has stolen and laundered cryptocurrency to self-fund operations including the acquisition of infrastructure.","[G1016] FIN13: FIN13 has observed the victim's software and infrastructure over several months to understand the technical process of legitimate financial transactions, prior to attempting to conduct fraudulent transactions.","[G1024] Akira: Akira engages in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files then encrypting them, in order to prompt victims to pay a ransom.","[G1015] Scattered Spider: Scattered Spider has deployed ransomware on compromised hosts for financial gain.","[S1111] DarkGate: DarkGate can deploy payloads capable of capturing credentials related to cryptocurrency wallets.","[G0083] SilverTerrier: SilverTerrier targets organizations in high technology, higher education, and manufacturing for business email compromise (BEC) campaigns with the goal of financial theft.","[G1040] Play: Play demands ransom payments from victims to unencrypt filesystems and to not publish sensitive data exfiltrated from victim networks."],"tactics":"TA0040 - Impact"}
{"technique_id":"T1667","technique_name":"Email Bombing","description":"Adversaries may flood targeted email addresses with an overwhelming volume of messages. This may bury legitimate emails in a flood of spam and disrupt business operations. An adversary may accomplish email bombing by leveraging an automated bot to register a targeted address for e-mail lists that do not validate new signups, such as online newsletters. The result can be a wave of thousands of e-mails that effectively overloads the victim’s inbox. By sending hundreds or thousands of e-mails in quick succession, adversaries may successfully divert attention away from and bury legitimate messages including security alerts, daily business processes like help desk tickets and client correspondence, or ongoing scams. This behavior can also be used as a tool of harassment. This behavior may be a precursor for Spearphishing Voice. For example, an adversary may email bomb a target and then follow up with a phone call to fraudulently offer assistance. This social engineering may lead to the use of Remote Access Software to steal credentials, deploy ransomware, conduct Financial Theft, or engage in other malicious activity.","detection":null,"procedures":["[G1046] Storm-1811: Storm-1811 has deployed large volumes of non-malicious email spam to victims in order to prompt follow-on interactions with the threat actor posing as IT support or helpdesk to resolve the problem."],"tactics":"TA0040 - Impact"}
