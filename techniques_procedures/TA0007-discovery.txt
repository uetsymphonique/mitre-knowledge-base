T1622 - Debugger Evasion
[S1213] Lumma Stealer: Lumma Stealer has checked for debugger strings by invoking `GetForegroundWindow` and looks for strings containing “x32dbg”, “x64dbg”, “windbg”, “ollydbg”, “dnspy”, “immunity debugger”, “hyperdbg”, “debug”, “debugger”, “cheat engine”, “cheatengine” and “ida”. [S1087] AsyncRAT: AsyncRAT can use the `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` function to detect the presence of a debugger. [S1200] StealBit: StealBit can detect it is being run in the context of a debugger. [S1183] StrelaStealer: StrelaStealer variants include functionality to identify and evade debuggers. [S1111] DarkGate: DarkGate checks the BeingDebugged flag in the PEB structure during execution to identify if the malware is being debugged. [S1145] Pikabot: Pikabot features several methods to evade debugging by analysts, including checks for active debuggers, the use of breakpoints during execution, and checking various system information items such as system memory and the number of processors. [S0240] ROKRAT: ROKRAT can check for debugging tools. [S0694] DRATzarus: DRATzarus can use `IsDebuggerPresent` to detect whether a debugger is present on a victim. [S1070] Black Basta: The Black Basta dropper can check system flags, CPU registers, CPU instructions, process timing, system libraries, and APIs to determine if a debugger is present. [S1018] Saint Bot: Saint Bot has used `is_debugger_present` as part of its environmental checks. [S1207] XLoader: XLoader uses anti-debugging mechanisms such as calling `NtQueryInformationProcess` with `InfoClass=7`, referencing `ProcessDebugPort`, to determine if it is being analyzed. [S1130] Raspberry Robin: Raspberry Robin leverages anti-debugging mechanisms through the use of ThreadHideFromDebugger. [S1202] LockBit 3.0: LockBit 3.0 can check heap memory parameters for indications of a debugger and stop the flow of events to the attached debugger in order to hinder dynamic analysis. [C0022] Operation Dream Job: During Operation Dream Job, Lazarus Group used tools that used the `IsDebuggerPresent` call to detect debuggers. [S1066] DarkTortilla: DarkTortilla can detect debuggers by using functions such as `DebuggerIsAttached` and `DebuggerIsLogging`. DarkTortilla can also detect profilers by verifying the `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` environment variable is present and active.


T1652 - Device Driver Discovery
[S0376] HOPLIGHT: HOPLIGHT can enumerate device drivers located in the registry at `HKLM\Software\WBEM\WDM`. [S1139] INC Ransomware: INC Ransomware can verify the presence of specific drivers on compromised hosts including Microsoft Print to PDF and Microsoft XPS Document Writer. [S0125] Remsec: Remsec has a plugin to detect active drivers of some security products.

[G1003] Ember Bear: Ember Bear has enumerated SECURITY and SYSTEM log files during intrusions. [G1017] Volt Typhoon: Volt Typhoon has used `wevtutil.exe` and the PowerShell command `Get-EventLog security` to enumerate Windows logs to search for successful logons. [G0143] Aquatic Panda: Aquatic Panda enumerated logs related to authentication in Linux environments prior to deleting selective entries for defense evasion purposes. [S1091] Pacu: Pacu can collect CloudTrail event histories and CloudWatch logs. [S1191] Megazord: Megazord has the ability to print the trace, debug, error, info, and warning logs.
