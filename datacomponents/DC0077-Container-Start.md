# DC0077 - Container Start

## Description

"Container Start" data component captures events related to the activation or invocation of a container within a containerized environment. This includes starting a previously stopped container, restarting an existing container, or initializing a container for runtime. Monitoring these activities is critical for identifying unauthorized or unexpected container activations, which may indicate potential adversarial activity or misconfigurations. Examples: 

- Docker Example: `docker start <container_name>`, `docker restart <container_name>`
- Kubernetes Example: Kubernetes automatically restarts containers as part of pod lifecycle management (e.g., due to health checks or configuration changes).
- Cloud-Native Example
    - AWS ECS: API Call: StartTask to activate a stopped ECS task.
    - Azure Container Instances: Command to restart a container group instance.
    - GCP Kubernetes Engine: Automatic restarts as part of node or pod management.

This data component can be collected through the following measures:

- Docker Audit Logging: Enable Docker logging to capture start and restart events. Use tools like auditd to monitor terminal activity involving container lifecycle commands.
- Kubernetes Audit Logs: Enable Kubernetes API server audit logging.
- Cloud Provider Logs
    - AWS CloudTrail: Capture StartTask or related API calls for ECS.
    - Azure Monitor: Track activity in container groups that indicate start or restart events.
    - GCP Cloud Logging: Record logs related to pod restarts or scaling events in Kubernetes Engine.
- SIEM Integration: Collect logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services to correlate container start events.

## Log Sources

| Log Source | Channel |
|------------|---------|
| `docker:events` | exec_create: docker exec events targeting running containers from non-CI sources |
| `kubernetes:events` | start: ContainerStarted or Pulling image → Started container |
| `containerd:runtime` | CRI CreateContainer/StartContainer with privileged=true OR added capabilities OR host* namespaces |
| `docker:events` | start |
