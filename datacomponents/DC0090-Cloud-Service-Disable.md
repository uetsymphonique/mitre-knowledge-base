# DC0090 - Cloud Service Disable

## Description

This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (`StopLogging` API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: 

- AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities.
- Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization’s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions.
- Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes.
- SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior.
